## 1.1.0

- New dynamic UI elements depending on screen size:
  - Display the statement types in the toolbox in multiple rows (up to 4), depending on the screen height.
  - Display the label for each statement type in the toolbox, depending on the screen width.
  - The following editors will now open in a centered dialog rather than a modal bottom sheet, depending on the screen width:
    - Function editor
    - Function parameter editor
    - Statement type picker
- New visualization for the "For-Loop" statement type.
- New animation when toggling between the "Editor" and "Code" views.
- Added a slight delay (100ms) to the statement type draggable in the toolbox, to avoid conflicts with the scrollable nature of the parent statement bar.
